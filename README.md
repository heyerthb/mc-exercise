Rotating position between Bob, Carol, and Alice, each of us experienced the following:
* Teams working off the master branch and merging from seperate comuters with different content.
* Not pulling from the master after it has been updated prior to beginning work on a new branch.
* Not communicating about new branches or committs. 

Things we should have done:
* Do not work on the master branch.
* Consistency of branch names and commit methods.
* Always pull origin master following changes to the master.
